Officer’s Representative Designation—Iraq.</p>
         <p class="p List3" id="DFARS-PGI_PGI_201.602-2__CDeFkC">(ii) DoD COR certification
standards define minimum COR competencies, experience, and training
requirements according to the nature and complexity of the requirement
and contract performance risk. These COR certification standards
should be considered when developing service requirements, soliciting
proposals, and performing surveillance during contract performance.
The DoD standards and policy are provided in DoD Instruction 5000.72, DoD
Standard for Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) Certification.</p>

be tailored to the dollar value/complexity of the specific contract
for which they are designated. For geographically dispersed large
contracts with multiple task orders, contracting officers should
consider appointing multiple or alternate CORs to assist with surveillance
duties. These CORs should have specific duties based on criteria,
such as geographic region or distinct task areas, to avoid conflicting
or duplicative direction. Contracting officers may exempt service
contracts from this requirement when the following three conditions
are met:</p>
