(a) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t13t16+492+90++%2815%29%20%20AND%20%28%2815%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">15 U.S.C. 637(a)</a>) established a program that authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into all types of contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. This program is the &ldquo;8(a) Business Development Program,&rdquo; commonly referred to as the &ldquo;8(a) program.&rdquo; A small business that is accepted into the 8(a) program is known as a &ldquo;participant.&rdquo; SBA&rsquo;s subcontractors are referred to as &ldquo;8(a) contractors.&rdquo; As used in this subpart, an 8(a) contractor is an 8(a) participant that is currently performing on a Federal contract or order that was set aside for 8(a) participants.
      </p>
<a name="wp1092799"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracts may be awarded to the SBA for performance by eligible 8(a) participants on either a sole source or competitive basis.</p>
<a name="wp1092800"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Acting under the authority of the program, the SBA certifies to an agency that SBA is competent and responsible to perform a specific contract. The contracting officer has the discretion to award the contract to the SBA based upon mutually agreeable terms and conditions.</p>
<a name="wp1092801"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The contracting officer shall comply with <a href="Subpart%2019_2.html#wp1085559">19.203</a> before deciding to offer an acquisition to a small business concern under the 8(a) program. For acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer shall consider 8(a) set-asides or sole source awards before considering small business set-asides.
      </p>
<a name="wp1092802"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) When SBA has delegated its 8(a) program contract execution authority to an agency, the contracting officer must refer to its agency supplement or other policy directives for appropriate guidance.</p>

19.802  Determining eligibility for the 8(a) Program.</h3>
<a name="wp1092806"> </a><p class="pBody">
Determining the eligibility of a small business to be a participant in the 8(a) program is the responsibility of the SBA. SBA&rsquo;s regulations on eligibility requirements for participation in the 8(a) program are found at 13 CFR 124.101 through 124.112.</p>
<a name="wp1092807"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
19.803  Selecting acquisitions for the 8(a) program.</h3>
<a name="wp1092808"> </a><p class="pBody">
Through their cooperative efforts, the SBA and an agency match the agency&rsquo;s requirements with the capabilities of 8(a) participants to establish a basis for the agency to contract with the SBA under the program. Selection is initiated in one of three ways:</p>
<a name="wp1092809"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The SBA advises the contracting activity of an 8(a) participant's capabilities through a search letter and requests the contracting activity to identify acquisitions to support the participant&rsquo;s business plans. In these instances, the SBA will provide at a minimum the following information in order to enable the contracting activity to match an acquisition to the participant's capabilities:</p>
<a name="wp1092810"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Identification of the participant and its owners.</p>
<a name="wp1092811"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Background information on the participant, including any and all information pertaining to the participant&rsquo;s technical ability and capacity to perform.</p>
<a name="wp1092812"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The participant&rsquo;s present production capacity and related facilities.</p>
<a name="wp1092813"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The extent to which contracting assistance is needed in the present and the future, described in terms that will enable the agency to relate the participant's plans to present and future agency requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1092814"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) If construction is involved, the request shall also include the following:</p>
<a name="wp1092815"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) A participant&rsquo;s capabilities in and qualifications for accomplishing various categories of construction work typically found in North American Industrial Category System subsector 236 (construction of buildings), subsector 237 (heavy and civil engineering construction), or subsector 238 (specialty trade contractors).</p>
<a name="wp1092816"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The participant&rsquo;s capacity in each construction category in terms of estimated dollar value (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g</em>., electrical, up to $100,000).
      </p>
<a name="wp1092817"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The SBA identifies a specific requirement for one or more 8(a) participant(s) and sends a requirements letter to the agency's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, Office of Small Business Programs, requesting the contracting office offer the acquisition to the 8(a) program. In these instances, in addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, the SBA will provide—</p>
<a name="wp1092818"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A clear identification of the acquisition sought; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>project name or number;
      </p>
<a name="wp1092819"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) A statement as to how the required equipment and real property will be provided in order to ensure that the participant will be fully capable of satisfying the agency&rsquo;s requirements;</p>
<a name="wp1092820"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If construction, information as to the bonding capability of the firm(s); and</p>
<a name="wp1092821"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Either—</p>
<a name="wp1092822"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) If sole source request—</p>
<a name="wp1092823"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) The reasons why the participant is considered suitable for this particular acquisition; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g.</em>, previous contracts for the same or similar supply or service; and
      </p>
<a name="wp1092824"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) A statement that the participant is eligible in terms of its small business size status relative to the assigned NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets; or</p>
<a name="wp1092825"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) If competitive, a statement that at least two 8(a) participants are considered capable of satisfying the agency&rsquo;s requirements and a statement that the participants are also eligible in terms of their small business size status relative to the assigned NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets. If requested by the contracting office, SBA will identify at least two such participants and provide information concerning the participants&rsquo; capabilities.</p>
<a name="wp1092826"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the purpose of identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA. Where agencies independently, or through the self marketing efforts of an 8(a) participant, identify a requirement for the 8(a) program, they may offer on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant, for the 8(a) program in general, or for 8(a) competition.</p>

<a name="wp1092861"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
19.804-3  SBA acceptance.</h3>
<a name="wp1096381"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Upon receipt of the contracting office&rsquo;s offering letter, SBA will determine whether to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA&rsquo;s decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the contracting office in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the offer if the contract is likely to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and within two working days of receipt if the contract is at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting office may grant an extension of these time periods, if requested by SBA.</p>
<a name="wp1096387"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) For acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, if SBA does not respond to an offering letter within ten working days, the contracting office may seek SBA&rsquo;s acceptance through the Associate Administrator for Business Development. The contracting office may assume that SBA has accepted the requirement into the 8(a) program if it does not receive a reply from the Associate Administrator for Business Development within five calendar days of receipt of the contracting office&rsquo;s request.</p>
<a name="wp1096376"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, when the contracting office makes an offer to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant and does not receive a reply to its offering letter within two working days, the contracting office may assume the offer is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract.</p>
<a name="wp1096390"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) As part of the acceptance process, SBA will review the appropriateness of the NAICS code designation assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer.</p>
<a name="wp1096394"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) SBA will not challenge the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer if it is reasonable, even though other NAICS codes may also be reasonable.</p>
<a name="wp1096395"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If SBA and the contracting officer are unable to agree on a NAICS code designation for the requirement, SBA may refuse to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program, appeal the contracting officer&rsquo;s determination to the head of the agency pursuant to 19.810, or appeal the NAICS code designation to the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals under subpart C of 13 CFR part 134. </p>
<a name="wp1096409"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Sole source 8(a) awards</em>.  If an appropriate match exists, SBA will advise the contracting officer whether it will participate in contract negotiations or whether SBA will authorize the contracting officer to negotiate directly with the identified 8(a) participant. Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a contracting agency, SBA will also identify that delegation in its acceptance letter.
      </p>
<a name="wp1096428"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Sole source award where the contracting officer nominates a specific 8(a) participant</em>. SBA will determine whether an appropriate match exists where the contracting officer identifies a particular participant for a sole source award.
      </p>
<a name="wp1096434"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on behalf of the 8(a) participant recommended by the contracting officer, provided that the 8(a) participant complies with the requirements of 13 CFR 124.503(c)(1).</p>
<a name="wp1096413"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant and the contracting officer, and may then nominate an alternate 8(a) participant.</p>
<a name="wp1096414"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) <em class="cEmphasis">Sole source award where the contracting officer does not nominate a specific 8(a) participant</em>. When a contracting officer does not nominate an 8(a) participant for performance of a sole source 8(a) contract, SBA will select an 8(a) participant for possible award from among two or more eligible and qualified 8(a) participants. The selection will be based upon relevant factors, including business development needs, compliance with competitive business mix requirements (if applicable), financial condition, management ability, technical capability, and whether award will promote the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts. (For construction requirements see 13 CFR 124.503(d)(1)).

19.804-4  Repetitive acquisitions.</h3>
<a name="wp1092869"> </a><p class="pBody">
In order for repetitive acquisitions to be awarded through the 8(a) program, there must be separate offers and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determine—</p>

SBA&rsquo;s acceptance of the original contract is valid for the term of the contract. Offers and acceptances are required for individual orders under multiple-award contracts that have not been set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors.</p>
<a name="wp1092880"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) An 8(a) contractor may continue to accept new orders under the contract, even if it exits the 8(a) program, or becomes other than small for the NAICS code assigned to the contract.</p>

(c) Agencies may continue to take credit toward their prime contracting small disadvantaged business or small business goals for orders awarded to 8(a) participants, even after the contractor&rsquo;s 8(a) program term expires, the contractor otherwise exits the 8(a) program, or the contractor becomes other than small for the NAICS code assigned under the 8(a) contract. However, if an 8(a) contractor rerepresents that it is other than small for the NAICS code assigned under the contract in accordance with <a href="Subpart%2019_3.html#wp1100639">19.301-2</a> or, where ownership or control of the 8(a) contractor has changed and SBA has granted a waiver to allow the contractor to continue performance (see 13 CFR 124.515), the agency may not credit any subsequent orders awarded to the contractor towards its small disadvantaged business or small business goals.
