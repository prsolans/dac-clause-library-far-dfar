Subpart 11.5—Liquidated Damages</h2>
<a name="wp1077555"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
11.500  Scope.</h3>
<a name="wp1078693"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for using liquidated damages clauses in solicitations and contracts for supplies, services, research and development, and construction.</p>
<a name="wp1078694"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) This subpart does not apply to liquidated damages&ndash;</p>
<a name="wp1078698"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) For subcontracting plans (see <a href="Subpart%2019_7.html#wp1088839">19.705-7</a>);
      </p>
<a name="wp1078699"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Related to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute (see <a href="Subpart%2022_3.html#wp1081696">subpart 22.3</a>); or
      </p>

(3) Related to paid sick leave for Federal contractors (see <a href="Subpart%2022_21.html#wp1096092">subpart 22.21</a>) 
      </p>
<a name="wp1077936"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
11.501  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1077558"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The contracting officer must consider the potential impact on pricing, competition, and contract administration before using a liquidated damages clause. Use liquidated damages clauses only when—</p>
<a name="wp1077559"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The time of delivery or timely performance is so important that the Government may reasonably expect to suffer damage if the delivery or performance is delinquent; and</p>
<a name="wp1077560"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The extent or amount of such damage would be difficult or impossible to estimate accurately or prove.</p>
<a name="wp1077561"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Liquidated damages are not punitive and are not negative performance incentives (see <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078229">16.402-2</a>). Liquidated damages are used to compensate the Government for probable damages. Therefore, the liquidated damages rate must be a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused by late delivery or untimely performance of the particular contract. Use a maximum amount or a maximum period for assessing liquidated damages if these limits reflect the maximum probable damage to the Government. Also, the contracting officer may use more than one liquidated damages rate when the contracting officer expects the probable damage to the Government to change over the contract period of performance.
      </p>
<a name="wp1077562"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contracting officer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate liquidated damages. If the contract contains a liquidated damages clause and the contracting officer is considering terminating the contract for default, the contracting officer should seek expeditiously to obtain performance by the contractor or terminate the contract and repurchase (see <a href="Subpart%2049_4.html#wp1083161">subpart 49.4</a>). Prompt contracting officer action will prevent excessive loss to defaulting contractors and protect the interests of the Government.
      </p>
<a name="wp1077563"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The head of the agency may reduce or waive the amount of liquidated damages assessed under a contract, if the Commissioner, Financial Management Service, or designee approves (see Treasury Order 145-10).</p>
<a name="wp1077564"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
11.502  Procedures.</h3>
<a name="wp1077565"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Include the applicable liquidated damages clause and liquidated damages rates in solicitations when the contract will contain liquidated damages provisions.</p>
<a name="wp1077566"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Construction contracts with liquidated damages provisions must describe the rate(s) of liquidated damages assessed per day of delay. The rate(s) should include the estimated daily cost of Government inspection and superintendence. The rate(s) should also include an amount for other expected expenses associated with delayed completion such as—</p>
<a name="wp1077567"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Renting substitute property; or</p>
<a name="wp1077568"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Paying additional allowance for living quarters.</p>

11.503  Contract clauses.</h3>
<a name="wp1077570"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Use the clause at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1141225">52.211-11</a>, Liquidated Damages—Supplies, Services, or Research and Development, in fixed-price solicitations and contracts for supplies, services, or research and development when the contracting officer determines that liquidated damages are appropriate (see <a href="#wp1077936">11.501</a>(a)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1077571"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Use the clause at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1141232">52.211-12</a>, Liquidated Damages—Construction, in solicitations and contracts for construction, other than cost-plus-fixed-fee, when the contracting officer determines that liquidated damages are appropriate (see <a href="#wp1077936">11.501</a>(a)). If the contract specifies more than one completion date for separate parts or stages of the work, revise paragraph (a) of the clause to state the amount of liquidated damages for delay of each separate part or stage of the work.
      </p>
<a name="wp1077572"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Use the clause at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1141238">52.211-13</a>, Time Extensions, in solicitations and contracts for construction that use the clause at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1141232">52.211-12</a>, Liquidated Damages—Construction, when that clause has been revised as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
