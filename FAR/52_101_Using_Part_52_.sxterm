[{"Name": "52.101 Using Part 52.", "Content": "(a) Definition.  Modification,  as used in this subpart, means a minor change in the details of a provision or clause that is specifically authorized by the FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision or clause (see 52.104). (b) Numberingâ€” (1) FAR provisions and clauses. subpart 52.2 sets forth the text of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers begin with  52.2,  since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses appear in subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each section of subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of the FAR provision or clause number (see Figure 1 below). (2) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR. (i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are- (A) Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole; (B) Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular suborganization; or (C) Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).) (ii) Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except that- (A) If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is published in the Federal Register and is codified in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and (B) The sequential number shall be  70  or a higher number (see 1.303). (iii) The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be  70  for the provision and  71  for the clause. (c) Prescriptions. Each provision or clause in subpart 52.2 is prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause may be referred to in other FAR locations. (d) Introductory text. Within subpart 52.2, the introductory text of each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in the FAR subject text that prescribes its use. (e) Matrix. (1) The matrix in subpart 52.3 contains a column for each principal type and/or purpose of contract (e.g., fixed-price supply, cost reimbursement research and development). The matrix lists the- (i) Required solicitation provisions; (ii) Required-when-applicable solicitation provisions; (iii) Optional solicitation provisions; (iv) Required contract clauses; (v) Required-when-applicable contract clauses; and (vi) Optional contract clauses. (2) For each provision or clause listed, the matrix provides information on- (i) Whether incorporation by reference is or is not authorized (see 52.102); (ii) The section of the Uniform Contract Format (UCF) in which it is to be located, if it is used in an acquisition that is subject to the UCF; (iii) Its number; (iv) The citation of the FAR text that prescribes its use; and (v) Its title. (3) Since the matrix does not provide sufficient information to determine the applicability of a provision or clause in the  required-when-applicable  and  optional  categories, contracting officers shall refer to the FAR text (cited in the matrix) that prescribes its use. (4) The FAR matrix may be reproduced at agency levels, and at subordinate levels, for the purpose of supplementing it with agency-developed provisions and clauses. The resulting consolidated matrices may be included in agency acquisition regulations. (f) Dates. Since they are subject to revision from time to time, all provisions, clauses, and alternates are dated; e.g.,(Dec 1983). To avoid questions concerning which version of any provision, clause, or alternate is operative in any given solicitation or contract, its date shall be included whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"ec9b201b-8b81-4f35-887a-eb1b3ed65d9b"}]
