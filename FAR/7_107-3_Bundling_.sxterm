[{"Name": "7.107-3 Bundling.", "Content": "(a) Bundling may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, before conducting an acquisition strategy that involves bundling, the agency shall make a written determination that the bundling is necessary and justified in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 644(e). A bundled requirement is considered necessary and justified if the agency would obtain measurably substantial benefits as compared to meeting its agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts or orders. (b) The agency shall quantify the specific benefits identified through the use of market research and other techniques to explain how their impact would be measurably substantial (see 10.001(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vii)). (c) Such benefits may include, but are not limited to- (1) Cost savings; (2) Price reduction; (3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency; (4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times, or (5) Better terms and conditions. (d) Benefits are measurably substantial if individually, in combination, or in the aggregate the anticipated financial benefits are equivalent to- (1) Ten percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) if the value is $94 million or less; or (2) Five percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, if the value exceeds $94 million. (e) Reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone is not sufficient justification for bundling unless the cost savings are expected to be at least ten percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) of the bundled requirements. (f) (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this subsection, the approving authority identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this subsection may determine that bundling is necessary and justified when (i) The expected benefits do not meet the thresholds for a substantial benefit but are critical to the agency's mission success; and (ii) The acquisition strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business concerns. (2) The approving authority, without power of delegation, isâ€“ (i) For the Department of Defense, the senior procurement executive; or (ii) For the civilian agencies is the Deputy Secretary or equivalent. (g) In assessing whether cost savings and/or price reduction would be achieved through bundling, the agency and SBA shall- (1) Compare the price that has been charged by small businesses for the work that they have performed; or (2) Where previous prices are not available, compare the price, based on market research, that could have been or could be charged by small businesses for the work previously performed by other than a small business. (h) If a determination is made that bundling is necessary and justified, the contracting officer shall include it in the acquisition strategy documentation and provide it to SBA upon request.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"21b38e60-9fd0-449f-a566-b1e675f980c0"}]
