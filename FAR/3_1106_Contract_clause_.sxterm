(c) Do not insert the clause in solicitations or contracts with a self-employed individual if the acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions are to be performed entirely by the self-employed individual, rather than an employee of the contractor.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"ae2c56d6-44ae-4517-a695-f8d7654468e1"}]
