[{"Name": "9.207 Changes in status regarding qualification requirements.", "Content": "(a) The contracting officer shall promptly report to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement any conditions which may merit removal or omission from a QPL, QML, or QBL or affect whether a source should continue to be otherwise identified as meeting the requirement. These conditions exist when- (1) Products or services are submitted for inspection or acceptance that do not meet the qualification requirement; (2) Products or services were previously rejected and the defects were not corrected when submitted for inspection or acceptance; (3) A supplier fails to request reevaluation following change of location or ownership of the plant where the product which met the qualification requirement was manufactured (see the clause at 52.209-1, Qualification Requirements); (4) A manufacturer of a product which met the qualification requirement has discontinued manufacture of the product; (5) A source requests removal from a QPL, QML, or QBL; (6) A condition of meeting the qualification requirement was violated; e.g., advertising or publicity contrary to 9.204(h)(5); (7) A revised specification imposes a new qualification requirement; (8) Manufacturing or design changes have been incorporated in the qualification requirement; (9) The source is listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see subpart 9.4); or (10) Performance of a contract subject to a qualification requirement is otherwise unsatisfactory. (b) After considering any of the above or other conditions reasonably related to whether a product or source continues to meet the standards specified for qualification, an agency may take appropriate action without advance notification. The agency shall, however, promptly notify the affected parties if a product or source is removed from a QPL, QML, or QBL, or will no longer be identified as meeting the standards specified for qualification. This notice shall contain specific information why the product or source no longer meets the qualification requirement.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"dfad9963-b814-4355-8e10-1dad17994cda"}]
