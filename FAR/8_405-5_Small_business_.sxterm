[{"Name": "8.405-5 Small business.", "Content": "(a) Although the preference programs of part 19 are not mandatory in this subpart, in accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (15 U.S.C. 644(r))- (1) Ordering activity contracting officers may, at their discretion- (i) Set aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3); and (ii) Set aside BPAs for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3). (2) When setting aside orders and BPAs- (i) Follow the ordering procedures for Federal Supply Schedules at 8.405-1, 8.405-2, and 8.405-3; and (ii) The specific small business program eligibility requirements identified in part 19 apply. (b) Orders placed under schedule contracts may be credited toward the ordering activityâ€™s small business goals. For purposes of reporting an order placed with a small business schedule contractor, an ordering agency may only take credit if the awardee meets a size standard that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System code assigned to the order in accordance with 19.102(b)(3). Ordering activities should rely on the small business representations made by schedule contractors at the contract level (but see section 19.301-2(b)(2) concerning rerepresentation for an order). (c) Ordering activities may consider socio-economic status when identifying contractor(s) for consideration or competition for award of an order or BPA. At a minimum, ordering activities should consider, if available, at least one small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, women-owned small business, or small disadvantaged business schedule contractor(s). GSA Advantage! and Schedules e-Library at http://www.gsa.gov/fas contain information on the small business representations of Schedule contractors. (d) For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, ordering activities should give preference to the items of small business concerns when two or more items at the same delivered price will satisfy the requirement.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"c6200214-cad8-4d1c-9294-39e485af5eb8"}]
