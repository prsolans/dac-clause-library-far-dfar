(iii) The fact that a firm has sold the same items to commercial customers at the same prices being offered to the Government. (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of the certificate, an individual may use a blanket authorization to act as an agent for the person(s) responsible for determining the offered prices if- (i) The proposed contract to which the certificate applies is clearly within the scope of the authorization; and (ii) The person giving the authorization is the person within the offeror’s organization who is responsible for determining the prices being offered at the time the certification is made in the particular offer.
