[{"Name": "11.103 Market acceptance.", "Content": "(a) 41 U.S.C.3307(e) provides that, in accordance with agency procedures, the head of an agency may, under appropriate circumstances, require offerors to demonstrate that the items offered- (1) Have either- (i) Achieved commercial market acceptance; or (ii) Been satisfactorily supplied to an agency under current or recent contracts for the same or similar requirements; and (2) Otherwise meet the item description, specifications, or other criteria prescribed in the public notice and solicitation. (b) Appropriate circumstances may, for example, include situations where the agency’s minimum need is for an item that has a demonstrated reliability, performance or product support record in a specified environment. Use of market acceptance is inappropriate when new or evolving items may meet the agency’s needs. (c) In developing criteria for demonstrating that an item has achieved commercial market acceptance, the contracting officer shall ensure the criteria in the solicitation- (1) Reflect the minimum need of the agency and are reasonably related to the demonstration of an item’s acceptability to meet the agency’s minimum need; (2) Relate to an item’s performance and intended use, not an offeror’s capability; (3) Are supported by market research; (4) Include consideration of items supplied satisfactorily under recent or current Government contracts, for the same or similar items; and (5) Consider the entire relevant commercial market, including small business concerns. (d) Commercial market acceptance shall not be used as a sole criterion to evaluate whether an item meets the Government’s requirements. (e) When commercial market acceptance is used, the contracting officer shall document the file to- (1) Describe the circumstances justifying the use of commercial market acceptance criteria; and (2) Support the specific criteria being used.", "Notes":"", "Uid":"92d3e4d7-d642-447a-9ad9-54f8d612134f"}]
