[{"Name": "52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards.", "Content": "As prescribed in 4.1403(a), insert the following clause: Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (Jun 2020) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause: Executive means officers, managing partners, or any other employees in management positions. First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by the Contractor for the purpose of acquiring supplies or services (including construction) for performance of a prime contract. It does not include the Contractor’s supplier agreements with vendors, such as long-term arrangements for materials or supplies that benefit multiple contracts and/or the costs of which are normally applied to a Contractor’s general and administrative expenses or indirect costs. Month of award means the month in which a contract is signed by the Contracting Officer or the month in which a first-tier subcontract is signed by the Contractor. Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the Contractor’s preceding fiscal year and includes the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): (1) Salary and bonus. (2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. (3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. This does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. (4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. (5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. (6) Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g., severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property) for the executive exceeds $10,000. (b) Section 2(d)(2) of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282), as amended by section 6202 of the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-252), requires the Contractor to report information on subcontract awards. The law requires all reported information be made public, therefore, the Contractor is responsible for notifying its subcontractors that the required information will be made public. (c) Nothing in this clause requires the disclosure of classified information (d) (1) Executive compensation of the prime contractor. As a part of its annual registration requirement in the System for Award Management (SAM) (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.204-7), the Contractor shall report the names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated executives for its preceding completed fiscal year, if– (i) In the Contractor’s preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- (A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants), cooperative agreements, and other forms of Federal financial assistance; and (B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants), cooperative agreements, and other forms of Federal financial assistance; and (ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(f) The Contractor is required to report information on a first-tier subcontract covered by paragraph (d) when the subcontract is awarded. Continued reporting on the same subcontract is not required unless one of the reported data elements changes during the performance of the subcontract. The Contractor is not required to make further reports after the first-tier subcontract expires. (g) (1) If the Contractor in the previous tax year had gross income, from all sources, under $300,000, the Contractor is exempt from the requirement to report subcontractor awards.

(h) The FSRS database at http://www.fsrs.gov will be prepopulated with some information from SAM and the FPDS database. If FPDS information is incorrect, the contractor should notify the contracting officer. If the SAM information is incorrect, the contractor is responsible for correcting this information.
